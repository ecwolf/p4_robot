## About P4+Robot control
Prototype implementation of a robot arm control use case boosted by a P4 program running in a near-by hardware switch. The P4 pipeline is able to parse and identify geometric position coordinates of the robot arm carried in  the payload of TCP segments exchanged between of the robot and the controller. Upon a threshold calculation, the P4 switch is able to rapidly craft a custom  stop message within the TCP connection resulting in an ultra-low latency command.
